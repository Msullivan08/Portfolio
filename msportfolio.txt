	<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
	<p>None yet. Give me a break!</p>
	<h2>Current Projects</h2>
	<h3>Action RPG</h3>
	<p>This is my long term project that I will continue to work on as I learn more about coding. This project is created using Game Maker Studio 2(GMS2). This game is at a <b>very</b> early stage of production and I need to learn more about coding before I can continue to work on it.</p>
	<h3>Tower Defense</h3>
	<p>This game is also created using <abbr title="Game Maker Studio 2">GMS2</abbr>, unfortunately I was following a tutorial that has not been completed. I dont know if the tutorial will ever be finished because it has been a long time since the user has posted a new video. Hopefully, I will be able to learn how to complete this game myself, as it is already functioning. I just need to add a few features to the game for it to be playable.</p>
	<h3>Pong Replica</h3>
	<p>This is a pong replica game that I am attempting to make without any help. It is literally pong. Currently unable to figure out collisions with the player/enemy objects and the walls. The ball trajectory will be a whole other story.</p>
	<h2>Computer Languages</h2>
	<dl>
	  <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a></dt>
	  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">
	    <dd>"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document."</dd>

	  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">
	    <dd>"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications."1</dd>
